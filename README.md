# Mock Stock
This is a stock market simulating GUI application where you can track the shares transacted between companies, the severity of the PR crises a company faces and the quality of the PR responses it releases.

## Features
1. You can create multiple "World"s to host different sets of companies. Each world will function independently.
2. Every action performed in a world can be reviewed in the 'Audit log' tab. Invalid actions (e.g Insufficient capital, Insufficient shares) are also recorded.
3. You can revert back to a previous configuration of the world by using the hidden REVERT button to the extreme right of every action displayed in the 'Audit log' tab.
4. Multiple tabs can be created and the fields displayed in each tab can be configured.
5. The title of the world and the editable fields in each tab (except the 'Investors' tab and the 'Audit log' tab) can be edited by double clicking on the text, modifying it and hitting Enter.
6. Dual Theme - Light and Dark
