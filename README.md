# Mock Stock Organizer
This is a desktop GUI application simulating the stock market where one can track the shares transacted between companies and also manage their PR crises and PR responses. 

## Features
* Multiple worlds can exist simultaneously. A world is analogous to a stock market hosting a set of companies which can interact with each other. Inter-world interactions are NOT possible.
* Every action performed in the world can be reviewed in the 'Audit Log' tab. Invalid actions (e.g., insufficient capital, insufficient shares) are also recorded.
* One can revert back to an earlier configuration of the world by using the hidden REVERT button to the extreme right of every action displayed in the 'Audit Log' tab.
* Multiple tabs can be created and the fields displayed in each tab can be configured.
* The title of the world and the editable fields in each tab (except the 'Investors' tab and the 'Audit Log' tab) can be edited by double clicking on the text, modifying it and hitting the Enter key.
* Dual Theme - Dark and Light
