# Mock Stock
This is a GUI application simulating the stock market where you can track the shares transacted between companies, the severity of the PR crises a company faces and the quality of the PR responses it releases.

## Features
1. Multiple worlds can be exist simultaneously. A world is analogous to a stock market hosting a set of companies which can interact with each other. Inter-world interactions are not possible.
2. Every action performed in a world can be reviewed in the 'Audit log' tab. Invalid actions (e.g Insufficient capital, Insufficient shares) are also recorded.
3. You can revert back to a previous configuration of the world by using the hidden REVERT button to the extreme right of every action displayed in the 'Audit log' tab.
4. Multiple tabs can be created and the fields displayed in each tab can be configured.
5. The title of the world and the editable fields in each tab (except the 'Investors' tab and the 'Audit log' tab) can be edited by double clicking on the text, modifying it and hitting Enter.
6. Dual Theme - Light and Dark
